# MitoScape
A big-data, machine-learning workflow for aligning mtDNA from NGS data.

## Cavatica Approach
Workflow and additional documenatation available at: : https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/public/apps#d3b-bixu/app-publisher/mitoscape-wf/, including full instructions on how to run MitoScape using the Cavatica framework. If you require help on running MitoScape on Cavatica, please look at the Cavatica documentation and reach out to the Cavatica team.

## Local cluster/server Approach
If you wish to run MitoScape independently of Cavatica, the following are the steps. You can use the fat jar including here or clone the source and create the fat jar with 
```
sbt assembly
```

I will be adding further instructions and sample scripts soon.

Please feel free to contact me should you have questions. I'll be adding more information as time goes on.
